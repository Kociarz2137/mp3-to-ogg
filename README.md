choosed

# Why this exists
There's a lot of mp3 to ogg converters on the internet, some are downloadable but these are mostly pay to use for some reason, and some are on full of ads websites where propably you have converting limit and converting 
5 or more files is worse than hell. I made this to make everything easier, add-free and most important - free to use. It's just stupid to pay for something idiotic thing like converitng files. Maybe this won't change the world but 
at least I can help some of you. 

# How to install?
Simply, if you want to download the source code just download the "source-code.zip" but if you want to use it just download "mp3-to-ogg.exe" and just run it!
